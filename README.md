When searching for new places to eat in your area, it can be hard to know what to expect, or find what you’re looking for. A study by researchers at Iowa State University highlighted the influence of environmental cues and images on consumer behavior as increasing stimulation on the viewer’s response. The study showed that seeing a picture of an item that looks good will influence choice (Smarandescu & Mennecke, 2013). Given the importance of visual cues on decision-making, many people would like to see photo examples of food from a restaurant before they try it for the first time. 

Currently, how do people decide where to eat? Digital channels such as Yelp, Foursquare, Urbanspoon and Instagram have replaced traditional media (newspaper and television) as the driving forces behind why people choose to go to one restaurant over another.

However, the only ways to see photo examples of food in existing digital channels require extensive searching and filtering: a user may first try to find different restaurants in their desired location, then look at the restaurant's individual photos, then repeat this process until a decision is made. This poses a problem not only for people who need to make a quick decision for a meal, but also people with a specific type of food in mind. 

One of our target demographics that currently faces this problem are people who want to choose a restaurant quickly based on the food they serve. College students and business professionals fall in this category because lunch breaks are often a time crunch. The result of being unable to find a restaurant in this limited time is unsatisfying and often results in eating the same food every day (Victor, 2015). Eating the same food every day deprives your body of essential nutrients that come from eating more diverse foods, and leads to unhealthy habits. On the other hand, eating a larger variety of food improves morale and promotes a healthy lifestyle (Duron, 2016).

We’re going to address this problem by creating an application that helps these people choose where to eat by showing photo examples of food from nearby restaurants, allowing them to find appealing food **quickly** and **easily**.
